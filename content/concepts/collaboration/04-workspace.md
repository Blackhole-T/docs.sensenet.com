sensenet allows individuals in an organization to easily create and manage their own collaborative sites, called workspaces. A sensenet Workspace is a special content type with libraries, lists and pages configured for a predefined goal. Workspaces may contain sub-workspaces, and further sub-workspaces.

# Where to start?
You can create a new workspace from built-in workspace types (Sales workspace, Document workspace, Project workspace, etc.), create one from scratch, or create a new template others can use. Every workspace has its own navigation, members (custom permissions) and many other settings that are related only to the given workspace. A root site is also a workspace, which means that sensenet sites are built from workspaces.

# Advantages
Workspaces enable teams to:

- share and store content relevant to the whole team
- limit access to workspace and its content
- collaborate on multiple level (info sharing, office online editing etc.)

# Other usage
We can distinguish two different types of workspaces:
- collaborative workspaces - where team members can work together on the same content and share info with each other (see above).
- workspace as a logical unit - used to formulate a separate area in the final solution (like subsites)

Logical unit means that you can have different workspaces completely separated (with workspace level users and trash) while the main  and For example in case of a public site when you want to create a subsite it is recommended to create a separate workspace for the subsite (start from empty workspace).

# Types
In a system built on sensenet there can be many different types of workspaces. It is typical to create new workspace templates for a new sensenet installation since the business needs are different for every organization. 

For demo purposes, you can use the following built-in workspace types:
- Document workspace - to collaborate mainly on documents,
- Project workspace - a demo workspace for typical collaborative projects (with tasklists and so on)
- Sales workspace - a demo for a sales process with built-in KPIs,
- Empty workspace - if you want to start from scratch

In sensenet the workspace content itself can be tailor made. You can freely add, modify or remove fields on every workspace type.

# Workspace level options
In every workspace you can:

- define the list, libraries and other content types users can create in the workspace
- turn on/off version history for any content in the workspace,
- turn on/off approval for any content in the workspace

# Usage
Workspace is a good solution when you want to create separate units (subsites, teams, companies)
