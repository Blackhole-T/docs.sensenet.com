You save time, resources (headache), and hardware costs.

# Advantages:

A basic setup of sensenet has three top level parts:

- a **content repository** that is the storage and service layer,
- an **application** that uses the content of the connected content repository through API calls and 
- **sensenet admin surface** that helps you do common content managements tasks or setup and keep your system up to date.
